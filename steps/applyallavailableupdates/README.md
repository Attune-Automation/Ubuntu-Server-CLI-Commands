The APT package index is essentially a database of available packages from the 
repositories defined in the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file and in the 
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory.

Installed packages on your computer may periodically have upgrades available 
from the package repositories (e.g., security updates).
